# beyond-money-value-and-value-itself

My 1st book managed in GIT.
This contains a main abstact believe we can set the mind of an individual to the right path that he can choose.

Value in it of it self is, at it's core, a subjective matter which one can set his own pespective on what is more valueable and what is not.

However, I believe in this day and age, in the modern era, people are now more confused than ever on what can be valuable for their life and what is not.

This is especially the case with money, where a piece of an expensive paper represents a universal value. While it has it's critical role in society, majority of men & women do not think about the products and properties value outsite of the cost perspective.

- "Does a car with a chair heater really worth the extra 5 grand?"
- "Does an old apartment really worth the price to live in center of a big city?"
- And so on...

In this GIT-book, I wish to cover all the subjects that can enlight people to spend money more wisely than they're now.
